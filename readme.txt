Instructions for Use:
The .zip file contains a folder named “teamProj” which contains two more folders, “common” and “main”. 
Enter the “main” folder and compile using “make”. Once the program is compiled, 
execute with the command “./cg05 vs.glsl frag.glsl” in order to pass in the required 
vertex and fragment shaders. Once executed, a window containing the toon shaded 
sphere will appear. In order to manipulate the lighting and texture, use the keys shown in the appendix below.
